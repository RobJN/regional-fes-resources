## What to do
1. Make sure you unzip the shape file in the NUTS_Level_1_(January_2018)_Boundaries\ folder
2. Edit the second cell to read in the shape files you want to read in, if it differs from what is already there
3. Run up to the cell that contains the phrase "#experimental things that might be useful in the future/inspire further things" to get the visulisations of whether the gsps are in the NUTS1 regions.
